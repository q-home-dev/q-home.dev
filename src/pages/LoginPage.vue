    <h4>Login</h4>
    <p>
      The "Login Page" is not set up yet. Since this whole concept, of software development hubs in more natural settings,
      is still very new, I am not exactly sure how it will work.
    </p>
    <p>I think this website will be "Open Source" on GitHub, but I am not that familiar with GitHub and running an open source project.</p>
    <p>Eventually, developers and hosts will be able to login and setup accommodation details.</p>
